a1.5
# Large performance gains over a1.4, regarding conditionals and functions.
+ Implemented internal modules system.
+ Added internal modules: "random", "input", "math", "objects", "filesystem", and "main" (loaded by default).
+ Added "else" and "elseif" statement to conditionals.
+ Made implicit casting error more detailed.
+ Added explicit type casting.
! Fixed improper type error types being in the wrong order.
! Improved variable declaration detection.
! Fixed error tracing.

a1.4
+ Added functions returning values.
+ Added string to Boolean casting.
+ Added string to number (Int, uInt, Float) casting.
+ Added a strict comparison, "==". This returns False if types are not equal.
+ Added argument checking, unrecognized argument warning, and invalid argument parameter errors.
+ Added string "greater than", "less than", etc. comparisons.
+ Added "malformed" string error message.
+ Added "throw" statement for controlling code flow and custom errors.
+ Added an unrecognized argument warning.
+ Added an error if an argument is passed with a value when it doesn't take any.
! Improved "and" and "or" operations.
! Changed "equals" to be a non-strict comparison. This will attempt to cast the values to be like type, and compare them.
! Made releases single file deployments.
! Fixed broken check for unexpected end of conditional.
! Modified "--debug" behavior so that a "tree" is printed for the line by default, with an optional "verbose" value providing more verbose debug information.
! Implemented basic "headless" mode.
! Temporarily disabled loading of static_values.kep
! Moved default static values out of static_values.kep

a1.3.2
! Fixed typo in "UNEXP_END_LOOP" error string.
! Fixed nested interval not properly getting scoped variables.
! Fixed edge case where intervals could not be nested within other intervals.
! Fixed breaking intervals ceasing execution of entire script.

a1.3.1
+ Live interpretation no longer exits on normal errors.
+ Improved errors and error messages.
! Strings that are not closed now trigger EOL errors, rather than forming a string one character short.
! Fixed edge case where an unclosed interval never triggers an unexpected EOP error.

a1.3
- Removed .NET installer from Kepler installer.
! Improved support for inline block comments.
+ Added support for "and" and "or" operations when comparing booleans.
+ Added support for loading files without "--file".
+ Added (and improved) prime number checker example.
+ Added "breakout" keyword, to break out of intervals.
+ Added "every" interval method. This can be used to run code at regular intervals.
! Changed file extension to .kep
! (issue #3) Fixed string literals being improperly formed when followed by text without a whitespace in between.

a1.2
! Fixed overwriting variable types when directly assigning via another variable
! Fixed inline block comments not actually working as comments (issue #2)
! Fixed tabs being treated as normal characters, rather than spaces
+ Added static NaN value and type
+ Added basic if statement support
+ Added >, >=, <, <= as valid comparisons
+ Added modulo math operation

a1.1
+ Added automatic typecasting in operations
+ Added static values
