## Welcome to Kepler!
This is my first ever attempt at creating my own language, and was done with little to no research beforehand (for better or for worse). While I'm sure my experience in languages like JavaScript, Python, and C# have influenced the syntax, I tried to make it as original as possible.

### What is Kepler?
Kepler is an interpreted coding language, designed to have very similar grammar as English. This language is mostly intended for beginners to aid in understanding syntax, layout, and other general programming ideas.

### Why interpretation?
Interpretation allows for faster prototyping and development. There's no having to wait for those pesky build times!
